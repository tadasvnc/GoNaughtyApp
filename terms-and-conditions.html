            <p>Last updated: September 22, 2024</p>
            <p>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms" or "Agreement") govern your use of the GoNaughty mobile application ("Mobile Application" or "Service") and its related products and services (collectively, "Services"). By using the Mobile Application and Services, you agree to these Terms. If you're acting on behalf of a company or entity, you confirm you have the authority to bind that entity.</p>

            <h2>Important Information</h2>
            <p>Please read these Terms, along with our Privacy Policy and Disclaimer, before using our Services. If you have questions or concerns, contact us at <a href="mailto:gonaughtyapp@gmail.com">gonaughtyapp@gmail.com</a>.</p>

            <h2>Applicability</h2>
            <p>These Terms define your access to and use of the Services related to the GoNaughty mobile application. They constitute a legally binding contract between you and GoNaughty. You must be of legal age in your jurisdiction to accept these Terms. "Including" means "including, but not limited to."</p>

            <h2>Registration and Agreement</h2>
            <p>To use GoNaughty, download the Mobile Application from the App Store. We reserve the right to deny your request to use the Services without explanation. By agreeing to these Terms, you consent to electronic communication for contracts and notices.</p>

            <h2>Adult Content</h2>
            <p>Please note that certain adult or adult-only content may be available on the mobile application. Where there is adult or adult-only content, persons who are under 18 years of age or who are not permitted to access such content under the laws of any applicable jurisdiction may not access such content. If we learn that an individual under the age of 18 is attempting to conduct a transaction through the Services, we will require verified parental consent in accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”). Certain areas of the Mobile Application and Services are not accessible to children under the age of 18 under any circumstances.</p>
            <p>For EU residents, if you are considered a minor in your country, you must have the permission of your parent or legal guardian to use the Mobile Application and accept this Agreement.</p>

            <h2>Billing and Payments</h2>
            <p>You shall pay any fees or charges for your account in accordance with the fees, charges and billing provisions in effect at the time a fee or charge is due. If Services are offered on a free trial basis, payment may be required after the end of the free trial period and not when you enter your billing information (which may be required prior to the start of the free trial period). If, in our judgment, your purchase is a high-risk transaction, we will require you to provide a copy of your valid government-issued photo identification and may require a copy of a current bank statement for the credit or debit card used to make the purchase. We reserve the right to change products and product prices at any time. We also reserve the right to refuse any order you place with us. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to limit or cancel purchase quantities per person, per household, or per order. These limits may include orders placed from or under the same customer account, the same credit card, and/or orders using the same billing and/or shipping address. If we change or cancel an order, we may attempt to notify you by contacting the email and/or billing address/phone number provided at the time the order was placed.</p>
            <p>In the case of third party charges, you are responsible for any access or data charges incurred by the latter, such as internet providers or mobile carriers, in connection with your use of our Mobile Application.</p>
            <p>We may change our prices at any time and without prior notice to our users.</p>

            <h2>Accuracy of Information</h2>
            <p>Occasionally, information in the Mobile Application may contain typographical errors, inaccuracies or omissions that may relate to product descriptions, pricing, availability, promotions and offers. We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions and to change or update information or cancel orders if information in the Mobile Application or the Services is inaccurate at any time without notice (including after you have placed your order). We assume no obligation to update, change or clarify any information in the Mobile Application, including but not limited to pricing information, except as required by law. No update or refresh date provided in the Mobile Application should be construed as an indication that all information in the Mobile Application or the Services has been changed or updated.</p>

            <h2>Data Security</h2>
            <p>Our Privacy Policy is part of these Terms and outlines how we protect your data. We implement security measures to safeguard your information and will not disclose it unless required by law.</p>

            <h2>Prohibited Uses</h2>
            <p>In addition to any other terms set forth in the Agreement, you are prohibited from using the Mobile Application and Services or the Content: (a) for any unlawful purpose; (b) to solicit others to perform or participate in any unlawful activity; (c) to violate any international, federal, provincial or state regulation, rule, law or local ordinance; (d) to infringe our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others; (e) harass, abuse, insult, injure, defame, slander, disparage, intimidate or discriminate on the basis of gender, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, race, age, national origin or disability; (f) transmit false or misleading information; (g) upload or transmit viruses or any other type of malicious code that will or may interfere with the functionality or operation of the Mobile Application and Services, Third Party Products and Services or the Internet; (h) to spam, phish, pharm, pretext, spider, crawl or scrape; (i) for obscene or immoral purposes; or (j) to interfere with or circumvent the security features of the Mobile Application and Services, Third Party Products and Services or the Internet. We reserve the right to terminate your use of the Mobile Application and Services if you violate any of the prohibited uses.</p>

            <h2>Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
            <p>All creative materials in the app are owned by us or our licensors and are legally protected. You do not have the right to copy or use these materials without permission.</p>

            <h2>Disclaimer of Warranty</h2>
            <p>Our services are provided "as is." We do not guarantee the app will meet your needs or be free of errors. You assume all risks from using the app and downloading materials.</p>

            <h2>Indemnification</h2>
            <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless GoNaughty and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, suppliers and licensors from any liability, loss, damage or expense, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising in connection with or as a result of any allegation, claim, action, dispute or demand made by any third party against any of them as a result of or in connection with Your Content, Your use of the Mobile Application and the Services, or any willful misconduct by You.</p>

            <h2>No Waiver</h2>
            <p>GoNaughty’s failure or delay to exercise any right or do any act under these Terms and Conditions shall not be construed as a waiver of such right or act, nor shall it in any way affect the validity of all or any part of these Terms and Conditions, nor affect our rights to take any subsequent action.</p>

            <h2>Changes and Amendments</h2>
            <p>We can modify this Agreement at any time, effective upon posting an updated version in the Mobile Application. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>

            <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>By using the Mobile Application and Services, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, you are not authorized to use the Services.</p>
